[Description]
Mod-EN=This mod adds challenges, a better AI, NPC management and some more general changes. It features a substantially upgraded general AI (almost all monsters call for help intelligently, choose sensible targets, and use magic items) as well as much better AI for a lot of specific types of creatures (wizards, priests, sirines, basilisks...). It also upgrades enemy challenges in special fights.
